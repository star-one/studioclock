A green LED denotes the current minute, and a blue LED denotes the hour.

Using the IP address to get the user's rough location and then a weather API lookup, on the 10 seconds for 5 seconds the digital time switches to show the probability of precipitation for this hour and the next hour, and the current temperature. On the 40 seconds for 5 seconds it switches to show the next of sunrise or sunset time, and the forecast number of hours of sunshine for today or tomorrow.

The feature to have chimes doesn't seem to be working on my computer in this version, but it didn't seem to be working in previous versions either. I may return to fix this in due course.
