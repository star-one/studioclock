A fork of `Ondřej Caletka <https://github.com/oskar456>`'s clone of the studio clock Chrome app
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/studio-clock/eclcdfoccndncapnfnellpcoidmjhckn>`
(`repository <https://github.com/oskar456/studioclock.git>`) with the addition of LEDs to denote hours and minutes.

The feature to have chimes doesn't seem to be working on my computer in this version, but it didn't seem to be working in Ondřej's version either.
